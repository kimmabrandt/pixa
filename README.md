# PixaPost
## About
PixaPost is an image sharing site intended as a way for users to collect and share inspiring images. Users can look through the image feed and add images to a favorites gallery. They can also delete images, or upload their own image to add to the gallery.

## How to use
On the main page you can scroll through the feed of images, and click on a photo to see a full size version. If logged in, you can create an image gallery. Click sign up to sign up, or log in to log in. Once you are viewing a full size image, click “add to favorites” to add, or “delete” (under the photo) to remove from your gallery. 

## Technologies used
*Express / node.js
*Bootstrap
*Tumblr API
*Facebook API/Oauth
*Sequelize
*Cloudinary

## Unsolved problems
*Upload - the form to upload an image works, however I didn’t have time to set it up to show the uploaded image in the feed
*In each image, a link to the original image on tumblr 
*Sort image by category - I had this working at one point, but it broke
